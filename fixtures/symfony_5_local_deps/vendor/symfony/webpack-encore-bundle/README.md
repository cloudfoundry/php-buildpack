WebpackEncoreBundle: Symfony integration with Webpack Encore!
=============================================================

This bundle allows you to use the `splitEntryChunks()` feature
from [Webpack Encore][1] by reading an `entrypoints.json` file
and helping you render all of the dynamic `script` and `link`
tags needed.

[Read the documentation][2]
