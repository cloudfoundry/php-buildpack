## Binaries

To reduce the time it takes for the buildpack to run and setup a usable environment, the buildpack makes use of precompiled binaries.  For general use, these binaries are hosted on S3.  If you're running on a public cloud like Pivotal Web Services or IBM Bluemix, you should be able to use these binaries without any problems and you probably do not need to read any further.  If you are running in a private environment or if for security reasons, you'd like to compile your own binaries, this document will explain what you need to do.


### Bundling Binaries With the Buildpack

It is possible to bundle the required binaries with the buildpack.  When doing this, the buildpack is self-contained and should have everything it needs to run.  This is not possible if you're using a public CF instance that is run by someone else (e.g. Pivotal Web Services), however if you're running a private cloud then you can install the buildpack (see `cf create-buildpack`), which is a nice option as the installed buildpack is local and will not need to download anything from the internet.

Here are the steps you would need to do this.

1. Clone the repository.  Check out a release branch, a specific commit or head.
1. Run `BUNDLE_GEMFILE=cf.Gemfile bundle exec buildpack-packager [ cached | uncached ]`.  This will download the latest set of binaries and packagae it with the buildpack that you have checked out.
1. Run `cf create-buildpack` pointing to the file that was generated in the previous step.  This will install the buildpack on your private cloud (as long as you have permissions).
1. Now you can `cf push` a PHP application and you no longer need to set the `-b` argument or specify the buildpack in your manifest file.

#### Use a Buildpack Bundle

If you're running your own CF installation, like with PCF or BOSH Lite, you can follow these steps to install a bundled version of this buildpack.

First, check if there is an existing `php_buildpack` already installed.

```
$ cf buildpacks
Getting buildpacks...

buildpack          position   enabled   locked   filename
java_buildpack     1          true      false    java-buildpack-v2.4.zip
ruby_buildpack     2          true      false    ruby_buildpack-offline-v1.1.0.zip
nodejs_buildpack   3          true      false    nodejs_buildpack-offline-v1.0.1.zip
go_buildpack       4          true      false    go_buildpack-offline-v1.0.1.zip
python_buildpack   5          true      false    python_buildpack-offline-v1.0.1.zip
php_buildpack      6          true      false    php_buildpack-offline-v1.0.1.zip
```

If so, disable it.

```
$ cf update-buildpack php_buildpack --disable
$ cf buildpacks
Getting buildpacks...

buildpack          position   enabled   locked   filename
java_buildpack     1          true      false    java-buildpack-v2.4.zip
ruby_buildpack     2          true      false    ruby_buildpack-offline-v1.1.0.zip
nodejs_buildpack   3          true      false    nodejs_buildpack-offline-v1.0.1.zip
go_buildpack       4          true      false    go_buildpack-offline-v1.0.1.zip
python_buildpack   5          true      false    python_buildpack-offline-v1.0.1.zip
php_buildpack      6          false     false    php_buildpack-offline-v1.0.1.zip
```

Upload your bundled version of this buildpack.

```
$ cf create-buildpack dm_php_buildpack php-build-pack-14.09.10-16.17.43.zip 7 --enable
$ cf buildpacks
Getting buildpacks...

buildpack            position   enabled   locked   filename
java_buildpack       1          true      false    java-buildpack-v2.4.zip
ruby_buildpack       2          true      false    ruby_buildpack-offline-v1.1.0.zip
nodejs_buildpack     3          true      false    nodejs_buildpack-offline-v1.0.1.zip
go_buildpack         4          true      false    go_buildpack-offline-v1.0.1.zip
python_buildpack     5          true      false    python_buildpack-offline-v1.0.1.zip
php_buildpack        6          false     false    php_buildpack-offline-v1.0.1.zip
dm_php_buildpack     7          true      false    php-build-pack-14.09.10-16.17.43.zip
```

Now to push an app using the buildpack you installed.

  - don't set the `-b` argument to cf push
  - remove `buildpack` from manifest.yml, if it exists
  - cf push

Alternatively, push and use the `-b` argument with the name of the buildpack.  From the example above, that's `dm_php_buildpack`.
